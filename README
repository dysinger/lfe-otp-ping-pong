This is an example of how you can use LFE to code Erlang OTP applications.

and Erlang / OTP @
  * http://www.erlang.org/doc

Example Usage:

$ ./build 
$ erl -pa ebin 
Eshell V5.7.3  (abort with ^G)
1> application:start(ping_pong).
ok
2> ping_pong_srv:ping().
{pong,1}
3> ping_pong_srv:ping().
{pong,2}
4> ping_pong_srv:ping().
{pong,3}
6> q().

As you can see it's not much - just a couple hours hacking, but it proves it
works and you don't have to code in erlang syntax to get erlang vm awesome
sauce.
